# Qwen2.5-VL-7B "Think with Image" Implementation Summary

## üéØ What Has Been Implemented

I've created a comprehensive system for training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with multi-turn reinforcement learning via Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for "think with image" capabilities. The system implements the core idea of "image as reward" alongside traditional format, tool, and answer rewards.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Components Implemented

### 1. VisionLanguageEnv (`verifiers/envs/vision_env.py`)
- **Multi-turn environment** for vision-language conversations
- **Image state management** (original vs. processed images)
- **Tool integration** with automatic image updating
- **Rollout generation** with vision-specific prompt handling
- **Reward system integration** with 4 types of rewards

### 2. Image Processing Tools (`verifiers/tools/image_tools.py`)
Complete set of 11 image manipulation tools:
- `crop_image` - Region-based cropping
- `zoom_image` - Zoom with center point control
- `rotate_image` - Rotation with expansion options
- `flip_image` - Horizontal/vertical flipping
- `adjust_brightness` - Brightness modification
- `adjust_contrast` - Contrast adjustment
- `apply_blur` - Gaussian blur effects
- `apply_sharpen` - Image sharpening
- `convert_grayscale` - Grayscale conversion
- `resize_image` - Resizing with aspect ratio control
- `get_image_info` - Image metadata extraction

### 3. Advanced Image Rewards (`verifiers/rubrics/vision_rewards.py`)
Four sophisticated reward mechanisms:

#### Self-Reward
- Uses the same model (Qwen2.5-VL-7B) to judge image processing quality
- Compares original vs. processed images in context of the question
- Provides immediate feedback without external dependencies

#### Teacher-Reward
- Uses a larger model (Qwen2.5-VL-72B) for more sophisticated judgment
- More nuanced evaluation of image processing effectiveness
- Fallback to self-reward if teacher model unavailable

#### Attention-Reward
- Analyzes attention patterns between image and text
- Rewards more focused attention on relevant image regions
- Uses model's internal attention mechanisms

#### Embedding-Reward
- CLIP-based similarity between processed image and question
- Fast and reliable reward signal
- No additional model loading required

### 4. Training Infrastructure
- **GRPO integration** with vision-specific optimizations
- **LoRA support** for memory-efficient training
- **Multi-GPU setup** (inference + training separation)
- **Comprehensive logging** with wandb integration
- **Dataset handling** for vision-language datasets

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### Multi-Turn Tool Usage
```xml
<think>
I need to analyze this image. It looks quite dark, so I should brighten it first.
</think>

<tool>{"name": "adjust_brightness", "args": {"factor": 1.5}}</tool>

<!-- Environment returns processed image -->

<think>
Now I can see better. Let me crop the main subject for closer analysis.
</think>

<tool>{"name": "crop_image", "args": {"x": 100, "y": 50, "width": 200, "height": 300}}</tool>
```

### Image-as-Reward System
The novel concept where processed images serve as continuous reward signals:
- **Immediate visual feedback** from tool usage
- **Quality assessment** of image processing decisions
- **Multi-modal alignment** between vision and language
- **Self-improvement** through iterative refinement

### Reward Composition
Flexible reward weighting system:
```python
reward_types = ["format", "tool", "answer", "image"]
reward_weights = [0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2]  # Balanced approach

image_reward_types = ["self", "embedding"]  # Fast combination
image_reward_weights = [0.7, 0.3]
```

### Configuration Management
Multiple training presets:
- **Development**: Fast iteration (100 samples, embedding rewards only)
- **Balanced**: Good performance/speed tradeoff (2000 samples, self+embedding)
- **High-Quality**: Best results (5000 samples, all reward types)
- **Memory-Efficient**: For limited GPU setups
- **Research**: Experimental configurations

## üöÄ Usage Examples

```bash
# 1. Start inference server
